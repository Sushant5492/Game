Get user input
user_choice = input("Enter your choice (snake, water, gun): ").lower()

Validate user input
while user_choice not in game_choices:
    user_choice = input("Invalid choice. Enter your choice (snake, water, gun): ").lower()

Computer's choice (fixed for simplicity)
computer_choice = 1

Determine winner
def determine_winner(user, computer):
    if user == computer:
        return "Draw match"
    elif (user == 1 and computer == 2) or (user == 2 and computer == 1):
        return "Snakes drink water, you " + ("lose" if user == 2 else "win")
    elif (user == 1 and computer == 3) or (user == 3 and computer == 1):
        return "Gun kills snake, you " + ("win" if user == 3 else "lose")
    elif (user == 2 and computer == 3) or (user == 3 and computer == 2):
        return "Gun drowns in water, you " + ("win" if user == 2 else "lose")

Print result
print(determine_winner(game_choices[user_choice], computer_choice))
